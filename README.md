# SC1015-DSAI_Python
NTU SC1015 Project

## About
This is a mini-project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence), we will be focussing on the World Happiness Report 2023.

Singapore was crowned the happiest country in Asia and ranked 25th in the UN's World Happiness Report 2023. Our group decided to dive deeper to find out how Singapore achieved its ranking, through analysing which factors were the most important in deciding happiness and to build a model to predict future happiness scores.
